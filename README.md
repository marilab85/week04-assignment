In here I'll have my reflections

For my Better Page Assignment, I decided to go with my own side business homepage remodel dream.
I am a certified facilitator and a crisis/conflict manager, and in the future, I want to become a consultant (let's say 10 yers from now?). This website is where I am publishing my own articles and reflexions.
I created it with the Wix AI tool from scracth a few months back, but it isn't exactly what I wanted, even if looks quite ok.

So, since we had the marketing sessions, I prompted Manus llm to analyze all my content at facilitatorlab.net + all the history of CVs and the "knowlegde" that this llm has on me, to write my Mission, Vision and Values in a backwards way... I am already saying the things I want to say or do, so the llm would have as a response, the most accurate answer to my Mission, Visio and Values session. And I have to say, pretty impressed. All of them resonated to what I want and expect with this particular project.

I was sttruggling with the "logical" sequence of a good html and style codes, so I did use llm again to give me a more logical sequence so I could understand better where is what. As we could see from previous weeks, my name giving is quite poor, so I followed Bertie's advice and will work on that. Once I got the "skeleton" right, I started to add my own things in there, and I was very happy with the results. I could use my own brand colours, and even the logo.

So far, as Marketing princlipals usage, I didn't add anything that could be actually sold, but started with one of my articles. Anchored the sessions, created a form in the bottom for my newsletter subscription. Added all the alts to the images...

I have a feeling I'll still struggle a bit with JS, but as far as html and styling, I'm getting there.
Had a few issues with github, but managed to get help from Bertie, and all good!

It was a great week. Thanks!
